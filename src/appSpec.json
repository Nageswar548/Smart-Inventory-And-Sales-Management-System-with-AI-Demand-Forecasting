Accent colors in subtle pastel purple and yellow appear in small UI elements, adding gentle vibrancy without overwhelming the design. Typography is geometric sans-serif, with large, bold headings paired with lighter, well-spaced body text to enhance clarity and hierarchy. The layout employs modular grids with generous negative space, balancing text and iconography in a harmonious, user-friendly manner. Buttons are solid, rounded rectangles with dark backgrounds and white text, emphasizing clear calls to action. Overall, the design conveys professionalism, approachability, and efficiency, making it highly adaptable for educational platforms, professional services, and technology brands seeking a clean and trustworthy online presence.",

The color palette is dominated by a deep navy blue as the primary color, complemented by white backgrounds and subtle lighter blue gradients in abstract shapes. Typography is clean, geometric sans-serif, balancing professionalism with approachability. The layout is modular and column-based, with generous whitespace and clear visual hierarchy. Rounded corners and soft edges on images and containers add a smooth, contemporary feel. Buttons are distinctly styled with solid and outlined navy blue variants, supporting clear call-to-actions. Overall, the design conveys a forward-thinking, reliable, and user-friendly technology or IT solutions brand identity.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color for main interactive elements such as primary buttons, icons, and key text to establish brand recognition and trust. The 'primaryForeground' color is reserved for text and icons placed on 'primary' backgrounds to ensure readability. The 'secondary' color, which is white, serves as the base background to maintain a clean and spacious feel, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text and icons on white backgrounds to maintain strong contrast. The 'gradientLightBlue' and 'gradientMediumBlue' custom colors are used in abstract background shapes and imagery to add depth and a futuristic touch without overwhelming the interface. The 'buttonOutline' color is used for secondary buttons and borders, providing subtle emphasis while maintaining a minimal look. This palette ensures accessibility and a cohesive visual experience across the website.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primaryForeground' on 'primary' color combination meets WCAG AA standards for text and icon contrast, ensuring readability. The 'secondaryForeground' on 'secondary' background also meets WCAG AA contrast ratios for body text and headings. The use of white as the 'secondary' background maximizes contrast and clarity. Gradient colors are used decoratively and do not contain critical text, maintaining accessibility compliance."
